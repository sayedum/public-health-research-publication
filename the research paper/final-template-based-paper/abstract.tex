Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) leading to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is very prevalent today. Over 37 millions of Americans have CKD. CKD/ESRD and interrelated diseases cause a majority of the early deaths.  Many research studies have investigated the effects of drugs on CKD to control CKD. However, less attention has been given to the study of the dietary patterns on CKD. Additionally, recent dietary recommendations shift is not extensively studied for impact on CKD patients. This research study has uncovered significant correlations between dietary patterns and CKD mortality, also between  dietary patterns  and CKD diagnostic markers such as the Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR). This study also compared the findings with Dietary Recommendations shift for Impact on CKD patients. In this study, Dietary surveys from NHANES, and CKD Mortality dataset from USRDS, Food Grouping datasets from USDA, Shift Recommendation study by CDC were utilized. Principal Component Analysis and Regression were utilized to find the effect on CKD mortality. Grains, Fruits, Alcohols, Nuts showed negative correlations where Vegetables such as Other Vegetables, Starchy Vegetables, and Red and Orange Vegetables showed positive correlations. ACR values were not found strongly correlated with dietary patterns. These finding are compared with Dietary Recommendations Shift study.
