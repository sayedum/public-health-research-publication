Concerns

1. Which template I use for the journal
https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/latex-instructions#crc

2. To show the comparision

option 1: in Introduction, I can provide the recommendation shift and in the result section I can just provide the comparison. I might have to repeat the recommendations to some extent in the results section.

Option 2: In Introduction, just mention that we have compared ourt findings with the shift recommendation without giving details. Then in the result section, provide both the recommendations and comparison.
